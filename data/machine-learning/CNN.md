A class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery

They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps

Regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons

Inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex

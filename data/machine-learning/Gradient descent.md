First-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function

Idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent

Generally attributed to Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847

Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades

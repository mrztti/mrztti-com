 A type of reservoir computer that uses a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer

 The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned

 The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can produce or reproduce specific temporal patterns

 The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons

 Belongs to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) family and provide their architecture and supervised learning principle

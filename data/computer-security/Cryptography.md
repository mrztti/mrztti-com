Practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior

Prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting information from a readable state to unintelligible nonsense

Designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary
